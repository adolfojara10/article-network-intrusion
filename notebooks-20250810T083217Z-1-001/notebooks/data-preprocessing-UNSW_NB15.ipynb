When you have a categorical variable, you need to transform it into a format that honors this assumption.\n","\n","Avoids False Order: Simple integer mapping (e.g., A=1, B=2, C=3) imposes an artificial ordinal relationship on the data. DirectLiNGAM might interpret this as a linear effect, incorrectly assuming that C is \"more\" of something than A simply because its integer value is higher. This can lead to misleading or incorrect causal relationships.\n","\n","Captures Individual Effects: One-hot encoding creates a new binary variable (0 or 1) for each category. For example, if your variable is color with categories red and blue, you'd get two new features: is_red and is_blue. This allows the model to learn the unique causal effect of being in the red category and the effect of being in the blue category independently, without any false assumptions about their relative order.\n","\n","Frequency Encoding is Problematic: Frequency encoding replaces each category with its frequency in the dataset. This can also lead to incorrect causal inference, as it loses the distinction between the categories themselves and instead models their causal effect based on how often they occur. Two different categories that have a similar frequency would be treated identically by the model.\n","\n","\n","One-hot encoding could be considered if:Many Categories with Distinct Effects: If proto has many categories (e.g., 10+ protocols), and each has a unique causal role (e.g., specific protocols strongly tied to is_malicious), one-hot encoding ensures each category’s effect is modeled separately.\n","Non-Linear Models: If you were using a causal discovery method that handles categorical variables or non-linear relationships (e.g., PC algorithm in causal-learn), one-hot encoding is preferred. However, DirectLiNGAM’s linear assumption makes this less relevant.\n","Domain Knowledge: If you know protocols have independent causal effects and you want to avoid any ordinal assumptions, one-hot encoding is safer, but you’d need to manage the increased dimensionality.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0bBdJdYlQKkt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","\n","# ==== LOAD DATA ====\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Data-science-project/journal-article/UNSW_NB15/data/UNSW_NB15_merged.csv\")\n","df.drop(columns=['id'], inplace=True)\n","\n","# Identify categorical and numeric columns\n","cat_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['object', 'category']).columns.tolist()\n","num_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()\n","\n","# Don't scale label column if it's the target\n","label_col = 'label'\n","if label_col in num_cols:\n","    num_cols.remove(label_col)\n","\n","# ==== 2.
